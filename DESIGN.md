The design is set up as follows

1. It all flows from upwards or downwards, although no scrolling is needed to see the entirity of the words. I made it this way since I didn't want people to just be mindlessly scrolling reading a wall of text, keeping it consice and digestable.
2. A border defines the main title, which is just a message saying hi to whoever enters. 
3. After a VERY convincing message for people to listen to my music, you are told 3 things. My first song, my favorite song (that I did), and the song I'm currently working on. 
4. These 3 are set up to have there own mp3, as well as a brief description letting you know what went into doing them and what they represent.
5. If you are interested in what is going on in the background, I made it so that the border of one of the texts expands massively downwards, thus letting you scroll to a portion of the website that is not covered by any text, letting you see the video in its entirity.
