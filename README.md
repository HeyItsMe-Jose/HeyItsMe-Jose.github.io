READ THIS TO UNDERSTAND

Hello! I am Jose and I decided to go thru with the creation of a website that showcases my personality, as well as my current project, with a music video to accompany the webpage of whatever I am currently working on!
To accomplish this I specified the details within the proposal, although I'll run thru them quickly in this File just to catch people up!
1. Utilizing HTML, CSS and DaVinci Resolve, I was to create a website thats memorable, showcases what I'm working on, and gives people an idea of who they're dealing with
2. It's meant to be updated with newer projects that are coming up, as well as having the background be a current music video I am working on!
3. It should be something that is memorable, and something that stands out, whether that be due to its complete beauty, or because of its odd and interesting look! (More the ladder)

I hope you enjoy and yeah, thats about it!
