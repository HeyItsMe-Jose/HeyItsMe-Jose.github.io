    <border style="position: relative; display: inline-block; text-align: left; vertical-align: left; margin-right: 180px;"><mark>This is the second song I did, this time trying to fully <br> express my difficulties dealing with OCD, specifically <br> when it comes to social interactions and social <br> gatherings. I divided the narrative into 3, with this <br> being the first part of said narrative. Overall I feel it <br> shows certain aspects that make me stand out, as <br> well as serving as a good starting point for the future <br> music that I would ultimately keep on doing. Also, <br> because its my second song it has some not so good <br> mixing, but I am still very proud nonetheless, as this <br> feels like the closest I've gotten to fully passing an <br> idea from my head straight into a DAW</mark></border>
    <border style="position: relative; display: inline-block; text-align: middle; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 100px; margin-bottom: 350px;"><mark>This is the very first song I ever released. It feels <br> not good for today's standards, althought I still is <br> an interesting thing to demonstrate, specially as a <br> way to show my growth as a producer! </mark></border>
    <border style="position: relative; display: inline-block; text-align: right; vertical-align: right; margin-right: 70px; margin-bottom: 1000px;"><mark>While not finished, this project shows growth in terms <br> of mixing, and overall quality, as now there's a more stable <br> sound to it all. I'm mostly proud of it because, <br> compared to before,  I was able to do this tune <br> very quickly within Ableton (my daw of choice). <br> For context, this is the second song within an <br> album I've been making for the last year now, <br> although this song specifically saw alot of changes, <br> which is why it's still in its early stages. <br> Nonetheless, this tune makes me happy, and it sounds pretty</mark></border>
