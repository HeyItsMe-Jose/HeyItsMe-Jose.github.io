Final Project!

1. I've decided to try and create a flashlight effect, but having it be synced to the velocity of what I'm playing. For this I feel like I can go on from the pdsequence file and work from there. Eventually the point is to have different sized responses depending on how hard I am playing, as like a desperate thing with the flashlight. Akin to a horror thing. Yes
