Points of Interest
1. I started out by looking towards SynthDef's code, specifically for the drill-'n'-bass coding tutorial-esque video he did. 
2. Looking into the very first parts, there's already quite a bit of interest. He copies and pastes the same code for the kick and uses it as a basis for the snare, something which while might seem obvious to some, it still feels as a very efficient use of code you already have within the session. 
3. The video is overwhelmingly long so I'd rather just focus on the drums put on the early stages and portions of the loop and such
4. The way he goes about the sequence feels economical, with defining certain things with only 1 character instead of the whole name.
5. Theres more, but thats saved for the presentation.
